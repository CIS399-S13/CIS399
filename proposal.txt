Spam Email Blocking and Filtering Proposal

Goals for the project and test methods
Blocking spam email from some DNS, the list of the blocking DNS will be searched from internet.
In this project, we cannot really receive spams from many different sources since our server address is not publiced. 
So we will test how it works by adding some DNS that we have email accounts on into the blacklist,
then send email from those DNS to the server. See if the emails are block.

Effect on its user population
Since the blocking method is not really acurate, some emails may be blocked even if it shouldn't be blocked.
User may complain about this problem. So we may want to make filtering as much accurate as we can.

Security issue
This project can give a cleaner environment to user so that they won't see too many useless emails. 

works need to be completed
1. Collect enough DNS blacklist
2. Implement the lists into sendmail configuration.
3. Implement a way to store spam in another folder, 
	and notice receipents that they have a spam in another place.
4. Test how it works.
