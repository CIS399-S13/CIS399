Spam Email Blocking and Filtering Proposal
Unwanted junk mail – spam – is an ever present problem for any organization that uses email. For most people will receive less messages, and the email service can clutter their mailbox and makes their work more efficient.

Goals for the project and test methods
In this project, we will update our email service and provide spam filter.By blocking spam email from some DNS, the list of the blocking DNS will be searched from internet.
Since we cannot really receive spams from many different sources since our server address is not publicized, we will test how it works by adding some DNS that we have email accounts on into the blacklist,
then send email from those DNS to the server. See if the emails are block.

Effect on its user population
Since the blocking method is not really accurate, some emails may be blocked even if it shouldn't be blocked.
User may complain about this problem. So we may want to make filtering as much accurate as we can. 

Security issue
This project can give a cleaner environment to user so that they won't see too many useless emails. 
Also, normal email messages are not entirely secure. Someone could gain unauthorized access to the mailboxes of sender or recipient. Except for very rare instances of hacking.To achieve this goal, the service will ensure that all emails have the correct address for the intended recipient.

Works need to be completed
1. Collect enough DNS blacklist
2. Implement the lists into sendmail configuration.
3. Implement a way to store spam in another folder, and notice recipients that they have a spam in another place.
4. Test how it works.
