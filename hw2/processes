	When the init command starts, it becomes the parent or grandparent of all of the processes that start up automatically on the system. First, it runs the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit script, which sets the environment path, starts swap, checks the file systems, and executes all other steps required for system initialization.

	ksoftirqd is a per-cpu kernel thread that runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load. Soft interrupts are normally serviced on return from a hard interrupt, but it's possible for soft interrupts to be triggered more quickly than they can be serviced. If a soft interrupt is triggered for a second time while soft interrupts are being handled, the ksoftirq daemon is triggered to handle the soft interrupts in process context. If ksoftirqd is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the machine is under heavy soft interrupt load.

	 Cpusets are logical, hierarchical groupings of CPUs and units of memory. Once created, individual processes can be placed within a cpuset. The processes will only be allowed to run/access the specified CPUs and memory. Cpusets are managed in a virtual file system mounted at /dev/cpuset. New cpusets are created by simply making new directories. Cpusets gain CPUs and memory units by simply writing the unit number to files within the cpuset.
