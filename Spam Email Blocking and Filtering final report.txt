Spam Email Blocking and Filtering final report
Unwanted junk mail – spam – is an ever present problem for any organization that uses email. For most people will receive less messages, and the email service can clutter their mailbox and makes their work more efficient.

Goals for the project and test methods
In this project, we will update our email service and provide spam filter.By blocking spam email from some DNS, the list of the blocking DNS will be searched from internet.
Since we cannot really receive spams from many different sources since our server address is not publicized, we will test how it works by adding some DNS that we have email accounts on into the blacklist,
then send email from those DNS to the server. See if the emails are blocked.

Implementation:
Since we already have the sendmail service installed to our server, we installed the spamAssassian to filter spam emails. 
After the spamAssassian is successfully installed, we integrated spamAssassin with sendmail. 
First, configure procmail to receive emails form sendmail and match these emails against a set of rules specified in /etc/procmailrc. 
Second, configure spamAssassin. Since spamAssassin works by analyzing each email and comparing the various headers and message bodies to a sample set of strings. Or, spamAssassin use Bayesian analysis to learn, analyze and keep the rules datebases up to date. The local.cf has some default rules, and it can also place configuration directives and rules.
Testing Impementation:
1. magical string test
	The testing string is "XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X", and when we send a email by pasting the string to the email body, our spamAssassian recognized the email as spam.

2. copying the spams which we got from the uoregon.edu email account, and sent them to the asian.ilab.cs.uoregon.edu email account. It works, and all the spams will be in the spam folder.
But if it forwards the spam from the uo email account or gmail account, it doesn't work. They still show in the mail folder.

3. useing http://www.maysoft.com/selfservespam.nsf/dl 
	This website can request to send a sample of known spam email by simply adding the email address. To create spams and send mail to the su@asian.ilab.cs.uoregon.edu. Most of the spams sent from the website were caught and replaced into spam folder. Only a few of the spams can show in the regular mail folder. 

Effect on its user population
Since the blocking method is not perfectly filter emails. Some emails may be blocked even if it shouldn't be blocked, or vice versa. Therefore, some emails could mark as spam emails even if it is important email for the user.  
Users may complain about this problem. To minimize this problem, we make spam filtering as much accurate as we can. 



Security issue
This project can give a cleaner environment to user, so that they won't see too many useless and fishing emails. 
Also, normal email messages are not entirely secure. Someone could gain unauthorized access to the mailboxes of sender or recipient. Except for very rare instances of hacking. To achieve this goal, the service will ensure that all emails have the correct address for the intended recipient.

In fact, there is not security issue for adding the spam email blocking and filtering function to the server, but adding the function of security to the service.

Works need to be completed
1. Collect enough DNS blacklist
2. Implement the lists into sendmail configuration.
3. Implement a way to store spam in another folder, and notice recipients that they have a spam in another place.
4. Test how it works. 

Further maintenance
Since spam blocking DNS are updating frequently. In addition, it is possible that the DNS we use can be shut down in the future. Therefore, we need to have a method to make sure the DNS is running and updated. 

The black list needs to be update frequently.(May be checking the new black list once a day.)
In order to keeping a better performace to filter out the spam, it needs to let the spamAssassian learning from text. (let it runs for learning twice per week.)

documentation
We should provide the documentation to solve some common problem such as, how to correct wrong marked email, where are the spam mail located, or how to configure the service, etc. In addition, users have to create their own spam list and configure their own spam rule.
